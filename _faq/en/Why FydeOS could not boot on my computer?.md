**Compared with other more traditional Linux distributions, FydeOS has special requirements for graphics drivers. This means that FydeOS can only run on some PC devices that meet the requirements.**

Currently, FydeOS for PC can only be started on PC devices using Intel x86 architecture processors. If you want to use the additional functions of the Android subsystem and the Linux subsystem, the device must have the fourth generation or later Intel graphics chip.

FydeOS (and its upstream project Chromium OS) is different from other traditional Linux distributions. It is highly optimized and integrated into the browser's graphics stack (including the underlying graphics driver, hardware acceleration module, and user-mode window manager module) for proprietary Technology, while providing higher performance and user experience for FydeOS, it also limits the compatibility of hardware.
