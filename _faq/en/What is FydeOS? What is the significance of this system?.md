**FydeOS (Fyde is pronounced like "fide" `/faÉªd/`) is a lightweight operating system with a Linux kernel + browser platform + container technology driver; its use is very similar to Google Chrome OS. **

**FydeOS can run smoothly on most mainstream hardware. Hardware devices installed with FydeOS can perfectly support the latest web application standards, are compatible with Android programs and Linux environments, and can be used in network environments in China without any obstacles, providing a Google Chromebook-like experience**

FydeOS is based on the second development of [Chromium Project](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os). We have modified and optimized its kernel, based on the most optimized browser platform, and added more localization enhancements that conform to the habits of users in China and improve user experience. Cloud technology operating system that t
ruly meets the needs of the Internet era. After a long time of accumulation of technology, we can make FydeOS run in more types of hardware devices and provide an overall solution around FydeOS.

Like Chromium OS, FydeOS was born out of the belief that the applications and services we use today will gradually move to the cloud. With the continuous maturity of browser platform technology and web front-end technology, we are convinced that most of the work you do today through the Internet can be achieved through a simple browser window in the future. We are entering a new era, and the applications that need to be installed will become history.
