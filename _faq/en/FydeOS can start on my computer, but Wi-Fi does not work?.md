We are working hard to improve Wi-Fi compatibility. If your computer uses the wireless network card chip provided by Broadcom, and you find that Wi-Fi cannot work on your computer after FydeOS is started, you can try to go back to the first page at startup and switch the Wi-Fi driver through "Advanced Settings". After finishing restarting the computer, the system will start another set of drivers we prepared based on Broadcom's wireless network card chip. Then the problem of Wi-Fi not working should be solved after switching.

If you still can’t solve the Wi-Fi problem, please post in the community and leave the brand and model of your computer’s Wi-Fi chip. We will try our best to adapt the chip in future releases.
