**To receive updates for your FydeOS for PC installation, the "Automatically keep my FydeOS up to date" switch under Settings needs to be turned on.**

There are 2 types of updates for FydeOS for PC:

 - Maintenance updates within the same milestone version, e.g. from FydeOS for PC `v12.0` to `v12.1`. For this kind of updates, it will be delivered Over-the-Air. Your FydeOS will automatically check for updates like these and will perform the necessary actions to download and apply the patches. Once everything is done, you will be prompted to reboot your FydeOS to the latest version - you can do this at any time to your convenience.
 - Milestone updates from one major release to another, e.g. from FydeOS for PC `v11.4` to `v12.0`. With FydeOS for PC, this kind of updates usually include Linux kernel version changes as well as modifications for other system libraries. Because we don't know the exact make and model of your PC and test them before releasing, in the unlikely event, things may break for you. Therefore we have decided to hold-off all FydeOS for PC to automatically apply these updates. You have 2 options:
    - You can download a new copy of the latest FydeOS for PC image and perform the installation to your PC once again. You can also verify if all features that had worked previously will still work in the new release. However, your previous installed apps and your personal data will be lost.
    - We will also be providing the option for you to update your FydeOS for PC to the next major release version Over-the-Air whilst preserving your installed apps and personal data, **at a small one-time fee**. However, for the exact same reason as mentioned above, it's recommended that you verify the working order of the new release on your device before proceeding.

The following is a quick FAQ for the update situation aiming to explain the rationale behind.

<br>

#### Q: Why charge a fee?
> A: It's pretty much the same reason as of why we launch the FydeOS subscription service for FydeOS for You releases.
> We hope to bring you the best FydeOS experience; **This means that we are not interested in inserting advertisements, reselling your privacy, and other inelegant monetisation methods**. At the same time, we believe that "donation" is a less controllable and somewhat unfair monetisation method. For the FydeOS update scenario, paying an one-time fee in exchange for the value-added services is undoubtedly the most direct and fair way.

<br>


#### Q: How much will I have to pay?
> A: 1.59 USD.

<br>

#### Q: What am I actually paying for?
> You are mostly paying for the CDN traffic to transmit around 2GB data from our update server to your local machine, as well as the upkeep and maintenance of our support cloud services that cannot be replaced by Google's offering.

<br>

#### Q: What if I don't want to pay but I still want to use FydeOS for PC?
> You don't have to pay. You can keep using the current version by turning the "Automatically keep my FydeOS up to date" off. Or you can install the new version of FydeOS manually to your PC just like you did earlier.

<br>

#### Q: Will I have to pay again for each major release in the future if I want to update it over-the-air?
> Yes.

<br>

#### Q: Can I get a refund if I don't like the update and wish to rollback to previous version?
> No. You've already consumed the traffic.

<br>

#### Q: What happens if the update breaks my machine?
> Sorry for that. It's likely that your machine is too old and it's somewhat not compatible with the update. You can rollback to the previous version(by selecting the alternative boot entry from the grub menu). 
> To avoid awkwardness like this, it's recommended that you verify the working order of the new major release on your PC by booting it on a USB device before you update it via OTA.
