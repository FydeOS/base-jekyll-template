Please note: Android subsystem and Android related functions can only be adapted to Intel series graphics cards.

After logging into the system for the first time, the system will automatically download the latest version of the support plug-in and required files from the FydeOS server. Please be patient. After the download is complete, these programs will be installed automatically, that is, they can be found in the "Application Launcher".

To run the Android program, you need to activate the Android subsystem carried by FydeOS. The first time you run "Android Settings" you can start the activation process. The Android subsystem has an independent set of "End User Agreement", please read it carefully. You can only activate and enable the Android subsystem by clicking "Confirm Start" after checking the consent.

After the Android subsystem is successfully activated, the setting interface of the Android subsystem will open immediately. The "Android Settings" program is the entrance to the Android Settings interface.

At present, FydeOS presets "Coolapk" as the default Android application store. You can download and install the applications you need. Of course, you can also download the apk file by yourself, double-click to install the apk program by "sideloading", or install an Android market program you like and install new Android software through the market program.
