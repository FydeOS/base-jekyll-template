The Google Play Store requires official Google authorization for distribution. The applications distributed through the Google Play Store usually rely on Google's service framework. Once the official authorization of Google is lost and the applications are installed into the operating system, these applications will often not work properly.

In addition, due to well-known reasons, the Google Play Store cannot be used normally in mainland China.

FydeOS currently presets "FydeOS App Store" and "Coolapk" (Android Subsystem Only) in the system, where you can get tens of thousands of extensions, Chrome apps, and Android apps.

If you have a certain hands-on ability and the need to use the Google version of Android services, you can obtain the relevant configuration program in the "FydeOS App Store" to configure it to meet your needs through the open source project "Open GApps". It should be noted that this feature is currently in the testing phase and cannot guarantee usability.
