After booting from a USB storage medium, confirm that the compatibility of FydeOS on your hardware device is sufficient to meet the requirements. Because the read and write speed of USB storage media is limited, you need to install FydeOS to the hard disk to use the full functions of FydeOS.

At present, we provide two installation solutions, one is ["full disk installation"](https://faq.fydeos.com/en/getting-started/install-fydeos-to-hdd/), another is ["operating system multi-boot installation"](https://faq.fydeos.com/en/recipes/dual-boot/). It should be emphasized that these tutorials assume that you are no stranger to the daily operations of multiple operating systems and have the most basic familiarity. If you find these tutorials difficult to understand, please seek the help of friends around you or go to [FydeOS Chinese Community](https://community.fydeos.com/) for help. If you are not sure about your operation, please do not continue.

Starting from FydeOS v11.3, the "FydeOS Installer" can be called from the first screen when FydeOS is started for the first time. You can install FydeOS to the hard disk of the device according to the prompts on the screen.
