The release and maintenance of FydeOS for You optimized for different devices requires significantly more investment than maintaining FydeOS for PC; a complete FydeOS experience also requires the support of a series of cloud services, but the operation and maintenance of these cloud services requires expensive expenditures. Sustain.

We hope to bring you the best FydeOS experience; **This means that we are not interested in inserting advertisements, reselling your privacy, and other inelegant monetization methods**.

At the same time, we believe that "donation" is a less controllable and unfair income method. For the FydeOS for You product and its usage scenarios, paying the subscription fee in exchange for value-added services is undoubtedly the most direct and fair way.

We hope FydeOS for You can help you. If you approve of FydeOS, please consider paying for the FydeOS subscription plan.
