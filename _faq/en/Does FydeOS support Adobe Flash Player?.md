Due to its closed design and lack of security, Adobe Flash Player has stopped updating and it is being eliminated by mainstream browsers. Starting from FydeOS v12, Adobe Flash Player is no longer provided by default. If you are still using a website or program that relies heavily on Flash technology, it is recommended that you replace it as soon as possible.
